# Brazilian-E-commerce-Analysis

### Project Overview
In this project, I embark on an analytical expedition into the vibrant world of Brazilian e-commerce. OMy mission is to unravel the complex web of online sales, customer behaviors, and market trends that define one of the most dynamic digital marketplaces in Latin America.

Armed with a rich dataset capturing a myriad of transactions, we will deploy state-of-the-art data science techniques to extract meaningful insights. My analysis will be anchored by Power BI and will leverage the precision of SQL queries to navigate through the data with ease.

The focal points of my investigation will include:

    Consumer Spending Patterns: Unveiling the rhythms of customer purchases across different regions and timeframes.
    Product Performance: Assessing which categories captivate consumers' interests and drive the market.
    Vendor Analysis: Evaluating seller success metrics and understanding the landscape of competition.
    Seasonal Fluctuations: Identifying and anticipating peaks and troughs in shopping activity throughout the year.

My objective is to distill complex data into clear, actionable insights that can empower stakeholders to make informed decisions. By the end of this project, I aim to deliver a strategic blueprint that can navigate the ebbs and flows of the Brazilian e-commerce sector.

### Recomendations
1.	Focus marketing efforts on Sao Paulo, as it has the highest number of unique customers. Tailor campaigns to the preferences and behaviors of this large customer base.
2.	Since 1-time installment payments are most common, streamline the payment process for this option to enhance customer experience.
3.	Consider promotional campaigns that might incentivize customers to choose less popular payment times, like 10 installments, possibly through discounts or rewards.
4.	Prioritize the credit card payment infrastructure, as it's the most used payment method, ensuring security and ease of use.
5.	Explore why boleto, voucher, and debit card are less popular and consider improving these payment methods or offering incentives for their use.
6.	Analyze the success of the Bed Bath & Table category to understand what drives its high number of approved orders and apply these learnings to other categories.
7.	For categories like Toys with lower approved orders, consider targeted promotions or product diversification to increase sales.
8.	Given that Watches & Gifts have a high average price and presumably a good margin, develop strategies to boost their visibility and sales, such as featuring them in marketing materials.
9.	Review the pricing strategy for Bed Bath & Table to ensure it remains competitive while maintaining profitability.
10.	Since 7-day delivery is preferred, ensure logistics and supply chain processes are optimized to meet this delivery expectation.
11.	Investigate the lower preference for 10-day delivery and consider improving delivery times or providing incentives for customers who choose this option.
12.	Investigate the factors contributing to the overall downward trend in the sum of payment value between September 4, 2016, and October 17, 2018. This could involve analyzing market conditions, customer behavior changes, or internal business changes during this period.
13.	Capitalize on the observed upward trend starting November 20, 2017. Analyze the marketing campaigns, seasonal offers, or any other initiatives that were in place during this time to understand what drove the increase and consider replicating these strategies.
14.	Leverage the high review scores (specifically score 5) as a marketing tool to build trust and attract new customers.
15.	Focus on expanding the seller base in cities with lower numbers of sellers, like Belo Horizonte, to increase diversity and availability of products.
16.	Use the high concentration of sellers in Sao Paulo to test new products or marketing strategies given the larger data set.
17.	Specifically for the sharp decline starting in June 2018, conduct a detailed analysis to pinpoint the exact causes and develop strategies to reverse the trend.
18.	Conduct a thorough analysis of the factors that contributed to the increase in the total number of approved orders between September 2016 and May 2018. This could include marketing efforts, market expansion, product line diversification, or improved customer service.
19.	Investigate the reasons behind the sharp decline in approved orders starting June 2018. Look into external market factors, internal operational changes, or shifts in consumer behavior that may have influenced this trend.
20.	If the drop in approved orders correlates with changes in marketing strategies or budget cuts, consider revisiting successful campaigns from the past.
21.	Evaluate the sales channels and platforms used during the period of increase and decline to identify which were most effective.
22.	Implement or enhance customer retention programs to prevent further decline in order numbers. This could involve loyalty programs, personalized marketing, or follow-ups.
